Welcome to the hardware folder.

Here you'll find the DXF files for layout of the front panel and the FPD panel to order from the creators of the
Front Panel Designer software. Also here are gerbers to order a PCB version of it from your favorite fab. I used 
JLCPCB for an aluminum PCB with black mask and white silk screen.

Not everything can be sourced at Mouser. You'll see those items down at the bottom of the BoM. As I build mine and
learn more about what parts are needed, I'll update the BoM.
