Welcome to the hardware folder.

**THE FRONT PANEL FILES FOR THE THONK JACK PCB ARE STILL IN ALPHA STAGE!** I will remove this comment and note when
they are ready to be used to order after finishing building a module successfully. 

**Update:** Received the Thonk jack PCB and installed it. The jacks do not line up with the front panel so the 
panel is undergoing another revision to adjust the holes to fit. The Doepfer version is done and everything lines
up and fits properly. 

Here you'll find the DXF files for both layouts of the front panel and the FPD panel to order from the creators of
the Front Panel Designer software. Also here are gerbers to order a PCB version of it from your favorite fab. I used 
JLCPCB for an aluminum PCB with black mask and white silk screen.

Not everything can be sourced at Mouser. You'll see those items down at the bottom of the BoM. As I build mine and
learn more about what parts are needed, I'll update the BoM. 

All components are SMT with the exception of the shrouded header, pin headers, input jacks, pot, and switches.

All resistors are 0805 with the exception of the zero ohm ones which are 0603. All capacitors are ceramic and 0603
with the exception of the 10uf which are 0805. There are no tantalum or electrolytic capacitors in this module.

**NOTE:** The Doepfer style verstion of front panel is done and verified, however, there is no PCB file for it. I
made it as I had traded for 5 PCBs. The rest of the modules I'm building will use the Thonk jack PCB I laid out.
It is not fully verified yet, hence not loaded here at this time.
