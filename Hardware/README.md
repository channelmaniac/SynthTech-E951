Welcome to the hardware folder.

**THESE FRONT PANEL FILES ARE STILL IN ALPHA STAGE!** I will remove this comment and note when they are ready to be
used to order after finishing building a module successfully. 

**Update:** Received a jack PCB and some NKK swtiches and installed them. While I still need to obtain and verify
the OLED display adapter PCB fit, all the other holes line up to the three jacks, the three NKK switches, the 
toggle switch, the mounting screw, and the 100K potentiometer.

Here you'll find the DXF files for layout of the front panel and the FPD panel to order from the creators of the
Front Panel Designer software. Also here are gerbers to order a PCB version of it from your favorite fab. I used 
JLCPCB for an aluminum PCB with black mask and white silk screen.

Not everything can be sourced at Mouser. You'll see those items down at the bottom of the BoM. As I build mine and
learn more about what parts are needed, I'll update the BoM. 

All components are SMT with the exception of the shrouded header, pin headers, input jacks, pot, and switches.

All resistors are 0805 with the exception of the zero ohm ones which are 0603. All capacitors are ceramic and 0603
with the exception of the 10uf which are 0805. There are no tantalum or electrolytic capacitors in this module.

**NOTE:** the first version of DXF, FPD, and Gerbers posted had an error in which the top mounting holes for the
module were 3mm too low. That has been addressed.
