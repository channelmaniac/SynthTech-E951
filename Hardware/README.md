Welcome to the hardware folder.

Here you'll find the DXF files for layout of the front panel and the FPD panel to order from the creators of the
Front Panel Designer software. Also here are gerbers to order a PCB version of it from your favorite fab. I used 
JLCPCB for an aluminum PCB with black mask and white silk screen.

Not everything can be sourced at Mouser. You'll see those items down at the bottom of the BoM. As I build mine and
learn more about what parts are needed, I'll update the BoM. 

All components are SMT with the exception of the shrouded header, pin headers, input jacks, and switches.

All resistors are 0805 with the exception of the zero ohm ones which are 0603. All capacitors are ceramic and 0603
with the exception of the 10uf which are 0805. There are no tantalum or electrolytic capacitors in this module.
